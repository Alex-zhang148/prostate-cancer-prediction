# Prostate cancer prediction

We consider data that informe about the level of prostate-specific antigen and a number of clinical measures on 97 men.
Of interest in the study is the relationship between the prostate-specific antigen (psa) and the clinical measures standing for predictor variables.
The data frame consists in 97 observations on 8 predictor variables and the response variable (lpsa).

The prediction modelling is achieved with regression models.
We first apply the standard linear regression as a baseline, then we consider regularized regression models: 
 
 * **Ridge regression**
 * **Lasso**
 * **Elastic Net**

We study the influence of regularization on the model.
